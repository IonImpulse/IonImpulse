<h2 align="center">Hello, I'm Ethan!</h2>

<h1 align="center">I'm a CS student at Harvey Mudd, trying to help the world and people around me🌎</h1>

<h2 align="center">I <i>love</i> using <b>Rust, Python, and Javascript.</b> I also have experience in R, C#, C++, Java, and Assembly. </h2>

<h3 align="center">🏢 What am I working on?</h3>

- 📚 [5scheduler.io](https://www.5scheduler.io/), my scheduling app (currently in beta) for the Claremont Colleges. Heavily optimized for super-fast, intelligent searching of over 2K courses. Supports custom courses, saving & sharing schedules in the cloud, automatic distance-between-classes calculation, mobile mode, and much more. Fully PWA compliant for installation and offline use. Built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

- 💠 [HMC Vector Arcade](https://github.com/IonImpulse/hmc-vector-arcade), a project I'm working on with a team of students. Together, we are building a vector arcade machine from the ground up, programming bare metal. I'm currently working on a simulator for the machine to test the game, and will be working on the embedded code once done.

- 🚀 [Rocketry Flight Computers](https://github.com/IonImpulse/MARC-Flight-Computers), a collection of several different projects that will come together to act as a full flight system for the **Mudd Advanced Rocketry Club**. I'm currently working on the flight computer (which controls the rocket mid-flight), the receiver (which receives telemetry data from the rocket), and the ground station desktop app (which takes data from the receiver and displays it in real time).

- 📦 Makerspace Kiosk, a webapp for managing the Harvey Mudd Makerspace, where I work as a Steward. Allows for easy inventory searching, safety quiz validation, and tool/material check-out/check-in. For security reasons the repo is private. Built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

- ⏰ [Blood on the Clocktower Discord Bot](https://github.com/IonImpulse/blood-on-the-clocktower-discord-bot), a Discord bot that automates the social deduction game "Blood on the Clocktower". Built using Rust and Serenity.

<h3 align="center">📝 What have I created?</h3>

- 💽 [HMMM-RS](https://github.com/IonImpulse/hmmm_rs), an full implementation of Harvey Mudd's custom assembly language. Can do compilation, decompilation, simulation, debugging, and auto-grading of HMMM programs. Built using Rust (and colorful terminal text).

- 💬 [Discord Stats](https://github.com/IonImpulse/discord-statistics), an analyzer for downloaded Discord messages, originally built for my friend's Discord server. Supports various statistics, including word frequency, total messages/words/characters/questions/attachements sent, vocabulary used, and more. Exports individualized .csv files for each user, a main server stats file, and a plethora of graphs. Can scrape and archive images and attachments. Uses multithreading to efficiently process 100K's of messages. Built using Python, rewritten and improved in Rust.

- 🧠 [Brain Box Alpha](https://github.com/IonImpulse/Brain-Box-Alpha), my senior project for my high school. Using a neural network trained on my classmates' essays throughout their high school years, it displays a *real* essay snippet side-by-side a *generated* essay snippet on a E-Ink display every 10 seconds *forever*. Built using Python & CircuitPython.

- 🤖 [Among Us Tasker](https://github.com/IonImpulse/Among-Us-Tasker), a program that automatically completes tasks in the game Among Us, and keeps track of task that have been done. Built using Python & OpenCV. Deprecated.

- 🎌 [Flag Architect](https://github.com/IonImpulse/flag-architect), my final project for CS3 in high school. Designed, programmed, and shipped in a week, it allows you to create flags using simple shapes and save/load them to/from a .flag file with full serialization. Built using Rust & Sciter. 

- 📅 [Multi Schedule Viewer](https://github.com/IonImpulse/Multi-Schedule-Viewer), a small webapp created while school was still virtual. Made so that my siblings and parents could keep track of everyone else's schedules and not distrub each other while in class. Built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

- 🦠 [Covid-19 Calculator](https://ionimpulse.github.io/History-Project-COVID-19-Website/), a website created for my high school history class right after the COVID-19 pandemic started. Using regression models in [this repo](https://github.com/IonImpulse/History-Project-COVID19), it gives you a risk assessment based on your sex and age. Built using Javascript & Python. Deprecated.

- 🧮 Education Timetable Solver, a program built to schedule class for my high school. Used various scheduling techniques, but being one of my first large projects, it was a bit of a learning experience, and mostly used brute-force solving methods. Built using Python. Deprecated.
